UniBioPAN is a universal classification model for bioactive peptides. 

UniBioPAN is designed to be universal, interpretable, and user-friendly.

Universality: UniBioPAN can handle various datasets without manual feature extraction, which improves the model's generalizability.

Interpretability: Ablation studies were performed to analyze the contribution of each module in the model architecture to the model performance, enhancing the understanding of the model's decision-making process.

Ease of Use: UniBioPAN provides three usage modes: web service, local training, and API interface, which are convenient for users with different levels of expertise and computational resources.

Overall, UniBioPAN is expected to reduce the development cost and experimental period of BP classification models and inspire the development of subsequent models.
